This article shows how to create a truly interactive app as you might with Dash with callbacks but using Plotly and Flask and a bit of AJAX. The code for this is in 
[plotlycallback-gm](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotlycallback-gm).

A slightly modified version of the code above can be found here:
[plotlycallback-gm2](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly/tree/main/plotlycallback-gm2). In this version no parameters are passed to the template and the chart is always loaded using Ajax. It also has the benefit of labelling the chart!
